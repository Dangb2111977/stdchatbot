About Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) At a glance Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also known as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are very common. Millions of new infections occur every year in the United States. STIs are preventable. If you have sex, know how to protect yourself and your sex partner(s) from STIs. STI or STD? A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite people can get through sexual contact. A sexually transmitted disease (STD) develops because of an STI and the term implies that the infection has led to some symptom of disease. People sometimes use the terms in one another’s place. The primary goal of public health and healthcare is to prevent and treat infections before they develop into disease. As a result, many - including CDC - are using the term STI more often. However, STD is still used when referring to data or information from sources that use the term. Types There are dozens of STIs. Some STIs are spread mainly by sexual contact, such as Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Chlamydia Genital Herpes Gonorrhea Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen) Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Syphilis Trichomoniasis Signs and symptoms Many STIs have no symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms, so people can have an infection but not know it. Therefore, it is possible to have an infection and not know it. That is why getting an STI test is important if you are having sex. If you receive a positive STI diagnosis, know that all are treatable with medicine and some are curable entire"}

About Genital Herpes Key points Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be treated. People who are sexually active can get genital herpes. This fact sheet answers basic questions about genital herpes. Overview What is genital herpes? Genital herpes is an STI caused by two types of viruses - herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 often causes oral herpes, which can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people with oral herpes do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes get it during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva. Genital herpes is common in the United States (U.S.). In 2018, CDC estimates show there were 572,000 new genital herpes infections in the U.S. among people aged 14 to 49. 1 Signs and symptoms How do I know I have genital herpes? Most people with genital herpes have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. Mild symptoms may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other skin conditions like a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people do not know they have a herpes infection. Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. This is known as having an \"outbreak\". The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, body aches, or swollen glands) also may occur during the first outbreak. People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if the"}

WHO estimates that 8 million adults between 15 and 49 years old acquired syphilis in 2022. Syphilis in pregnancy, when not treated, treated late or treated with the incorrect antibiotic, results in 50−80% of cases with adverse birth outcomes. Key populations such as gay men and other men who have sex with men are disproportionately affected. Overview Syphilis is a preventable and curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI). If untreated, it can cause serious health issues. Many people with syphilis do not have symptoms or do not notice them. Syphilis is transmitted during oral, vaginal and anal sex, in pregnancy and through blood transfusion. Syphilis in pregnancy may lead to stillbirth, newborn death and babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis). Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex can prevent syphilis. Rapid tests can provide results in a few minutes, which allows treatment initiation on the same clinic visit. Symptoms Many people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms. They can also go unnoticed by healthcare providers. Untreated, syphilis lasts many years. Syphilis has several stages. Primary syphilis (first stage): usually lasts around 21 days a round, painless, usually hard sore (chancre) appears on the genitals, anus or elsewhere the chancre may not be noticed and will heal in 3- 10 days progresses to the second stage if untreated. Syphilis can be transmitted through chancres if they are not properly covered by a condom during sexual contact.

It is treatable and curable. In 2020 there were approximately 156 million new cases of T. vaginalis infection among people aged 15- 49 years old. In females, trichomoniasis is a common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with poor birth outcomes and increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Infection with T. vaginalis is also associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition. Overview Trichomonas vaginalis is a preventable and curable sexually transmitted protozoan that infects the urogenital tract. More than 50% of women with Trichomonas vaginalis infection have vaginal discharge and about 10% of men have urethritis or urethral discharge. Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex can prevent trichomoniasis. Scope of the problem Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral STI. There were an estimated 156 million new cases of T. vaginalis infection among people aged 15- 49 years old in 2020 globally in 2020 (73.7 million in females, 82.6 million in males). Approximately one third of new infections in this age group occur in the WHO African Region, followed by the Region of the Americas. Transmission Sexually active people can get trichomoniasis by having sex without a condom with a partner who has trichomoniasis. Symptoms Trichomoniasis infection in women may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.

An estimated 520 million people aged 15- 49 (13%) worldwide have herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, the main cause of genital herpes. Most HSV infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized, but symptoms of herpes include painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time. An estimated 205 million people aged 15- 49 (5.3%) experienced at least one symptomatic episode of genital herpes in 2020 (1) . Infection with HSV-2 increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. Overview Herpes simplex virus (HSV), known as herpes, is a common infection that can cause painful blisters or ulcers. It primarily spreads by skin-to-skin contact. It is treatable but not curable. There are two types of herpes simplex virus. Type 1 (HSV-1) mostly spreads by oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes. Most adults are infected with HSV-1. Type 2 (HSV-2) spreads by sexual contact and causes genital herpes. Most people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time. Medicines can reduce symptoms but can’t cure the infection. Recurrent symptoms of both oral and genital herpes may be distressing. Genital herpes may also be stigmatizing and have an impact on sexual relationships.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally with around 660 000 new cases and around 350 000 deaths in 2022. The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in low- and middle-income countries. This reflects major inequities driven by lack of access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment services and social and economic determinants. Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Women living with HIV are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to women without HIV. Countries worldwide are accelerating efforts to eliminate cervical cancer, guided by the global 90- 70- 90 targets: 90% of girls fully vaccinated with HPV vaccine by age 15, 70% of women screened by ages 35 and 45, and 90% of women with pre-cancer or invasive cancer receiving appropriate treatment.

In the same year, about 94% of the 350 000 deaths caused by cervical cancer occurred in low- and middle-income countries. The highest rates of incidence and mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and South-East Asia.

The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, in early childhood, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids during sex with an infected partner, unsafe injections or exposures to sharp instruments. WHO estimates that 254 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2022, with 1.2 million new infections each year. In 2022, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 1.1 million deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccines that are safe, available and effective. Overview Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. The infection can be acute (short and severe) or chronic (long term). Hepatitis B can cause a chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. It can spread through contact with infected body fluids like blood, saliva, vaginal fluids and semen. It can also be passed from a mother to her baby. Hepatitis B can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. The vaccine is usually given soon after birth with boosters a few weeks later. It offers nearly 100% protection against the virus. Hepatitis B is a major global health problem.

This is the most common way that it spreads. By sharing drug needles. Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV. From mother to fetus during pregnancy . From mother to baby during, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Who is at risk for HIV infection? Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it: People who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI). Having an STI can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV. People who inject drugs with shared needles. Gay and bisexual men. Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans.

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver . Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a type of viral hepatitis. It can cause an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection. People with an acute infection usually get better on their own without treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B will need treatment. Thanks to a vaccine, hepatitis B is not very common in the United States. It is more common in certain parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. What causes hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus spreads through contact with blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person who has the virus. Who is at risk for hepatitis B? Anyone can get hepatitis B, but the risk is higher in: Infants born to mothers who have hepatitis B People who inject drugs or share needles, syringes, and other types of drug equipment Sex partners of people with hepatitis B, especially if they are not using latex or polyurethane condoms during sex Men who have sex with men People who live with someone who has hepatitis B, especially if they use the same razor, toothbrush, or nail clippers Health care and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood on the job Hemodialysis patients People who have lived in or traveled often to parts of the world where hepatitis B is common People who have diabetes , hepatitis C , or HIV What are the symptoms of hepatitis B?

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 200 related viruses. Some of them are spread through sexual contact. Most people have been exposed to HPV. Usually, your immune system controls HPV infections, and they go away on their own and don't cause any health problems, but some need treatment. There are two categories of sexually transmitted HPV. They are called low-risk HPV and high-risk HPV. Sometimes high-risk HPV infections can stay at the cervix (the lower part of a woman's uterus) for many years. This can lead to cell changes. If these changes are not screened for and treated, they may get worse over time and become cancer. Low-risk HPVM can cause warts on or around your genitals , anus, mouth, or throat. High-risk HPV can cause various cancers: Cervical cancer Anal cancer Oropharyngeal cancer, a type of head and neck cancer, also called throat cancer Vulvar cancer Vaginal cancer Penile cancer Who is at risk for HPV infections? HPV infections are very common. Nearly all sexually active people are infected with HPV soon after they become sexually active. What are the symptoms of HPV infections? Some people get warts from certain low-risk HPV infections, but the other types (including the high-risk types) have no symptoms. If a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years and causes cell changes, you may have symptoms. You may also have symptoms if those cell changes develop into cancer. Which symptoms you have depends on which part of your body is affected. How are HPV infections diagnosed? Health care providers can usually find out if you have warts by looking at them. Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by a long-lasting infection with a high-risk type o"}

Although PrEP protects against HIV during sex without a condom or if a condom fails, it does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and should be used with condoms when possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two HIV PrEP pills ( Truvada and Descovy ) and two long-acting injectable PrEP medicines ( Apretude and Yeztugo ), each of which must be taken exactly as prescribed to be effective in reducing the risk of HIV."}

PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. The word “prophylaxis” means to prevent or control the spread of an infection or disease. Four HIV medicines are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as PrEP: Truvada (or a generic equivalent), a pill taken by mouth every day. Descovy (or a generic equivalent), a pill taken by mouth every day. Apretude, a shot taken every two months. Yeztugo, a shot taken every six months. Which medicine to use for PrEP depends on a person’s individual situation. PrEP works by blocking the HIV life cycle , preventing the virus from taking hold and spreading if exposed during sex or injection drug use. However, its effectiveness relies on taking the medication as prescribed to ensure there is enough medicine in the bloodstream to stop the virus from spreading. Should I consider taking PrEP? PrEP is used by people who do not have HIV and are at high risk of being exposed to HIV through sex or injection drug use. If you have HIV, PrEP medicine is not for you. Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you should consider PrEP if you are HIV negative, have had anal or vaginal sex in the past six months, and: Have a sexual partner with HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load ), or Have not consistently used a condom , or Have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past six months. PrEP is also recommended if you inject drugs and you: Have an injection partner with HIV, or Share needles, syringes, or other equipment to inject drugs. PrEP should also be considered for people without HIV who have been prescribed non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and: Report continued unsafe sex practices, or Have used multi"}

PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. The word “prophylaxis” means to prevent or control the spread of an infection or disease. PEP refers to the use of HIV medicines to prevent HIV infection within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure. PEP should be used only in emergency situations and is not meant for regular use by people who may be exposed to HIV frequently. PEP is not intended to replace the regular use of other HIV prevention methods, such as consistent and proper use of condoms during sex or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is different than PEP, in that people at risk for HIV take a specific HIV medicine daily or an injection every two months to prevent getting HIV before an exposure occurs. For more information, see the HIVinfo fact sheets on The Basics of HIV Prevention and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) . Who should consider taking PEP? PEP may be prescribed for people who do not have HIV or who do not know their HIV status, and who in the last 72 hours: May have been exposed to HIV during sex Shared needles or other equipment (works) to inject drugs Were sexually assaulted May have been exposed to HIV at work (occupational exposure) If you think you were recently exposed to HIV, talk to your health care provider or an emergency room doctor about PEP immediately. When should PEP be started? PEP must be started within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV. The sooner PEP is started after a possible HIV exposure, the better. Every hour counts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , PEP will most likely not prevent HIV infection if it is started more than 72 hours after a person is exposed to HIV.

Acute and Chronic HIV How Is HIV Transmitted? Who Is at Risk for HIV? Symptoms of HIV What Are HIV and AIDS? Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on Email What Is HIV? HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment. If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ). The human body canât get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life. Luckily, however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If a personâs viral load is so low that a standard lab canât detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can live long and healthy lives and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex . In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) , medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) , HIV medicine taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold.

Bệnh do một loại vi khuẩn có tên là Chlamydia trachomatis gây ra. Bệnh được điều trị và chữa khỏi bằng thuốc kháng sinh. Nếu không được điều trị, Chlamydia có thể tạo điều kiện cho việc lây truyền và mắc phải HIV và các bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục khác. Chlamydia còn có nguy cơ gây ra các vấn đề nghiêm trọng như bệnh viêm vùng chậu , tăng nguy cơ vô sinh, thai ngoài tử cung. Ở phụ nữ mang thai, bệnh có thể khiến em bé sinh non hoặc nhẹ cân khi sinh. BSCKI. Võ Thị Tường Duy, Phòng khám Đa khoa Tâm Anh Quận 7, TPHCM cho biết, quan hệ tình dục không an toàn là nguyên nhân chính lây truyền bệnh Chlamydia. Một người mắc Chlamydia có thể lây bệnh sang bạn tình của mình, thông qua quan hệ tình dục bằng đường hậu môn, miệng hoặc âm đạo. Bạn tình càng nhiều, nguy cơ lây nhiễm bệnh càng cao. Bên cạnh đó, Chlamydia có thể lây truyền từ mẹ sang con qua nhau thai hoặc dùng chung đồ chơi tình dục với người nhiễm bệnh. Sử dụng bao cao su đúng cách và thường xuyên khi quan hệ tình dục là cách hiệu quả nhất để phòng ngừa bệnh Chlamydia, WHO cho biết. 2.

SKĐS - Bệnh lậu là một trong những bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục phổ biến. Mặc dù dễ mắc phải, nhiều người lại không nhận ra mình đang mang mầm bệnh, biến nó thành một mối đe dọa thầm lặng nhưng cực kỳ nguy hiểm. 1. Bệnh lậu là một \"kẻ thù\" thầm lặng 2.

Tầm quan trọng của việc sàng lọc và điều trị bệnh lậu 3. Tầm quan trọng của việc sàng lọc và điều trị bệnh lậu 1. Bệnh lậu là một \"kẻ thù\" thầm lặng Sự nguy hiểm lớn nhất của bệnh lậu nằm ở việc nó thường không có triệu chứng rõ ràng, đặc biệt là ở phụ nữ. Trong khi nam giới có thể nhận thấy các dấu hiệu sớm hơn như tiết dịch từ dương vật hay đau khi đi tiểu, thì những triệu chứng này có thể bị bỏ qua, dẫn đến việc lây lan không kiểm soát. Khi có triệu chứng, bệnh thường biểu hiện ở các khu vực phơi nhiễm như bộ phận sinh dục, trực tràng hoặc cổ họng. Ở phụ nữ, các dấu hiệu có thể là tiết dịch âm đạo, chảy máu giữa các kỳ kinh hoặc đau khi quan hệ . Ở nam giới, ngoài các triệu chứng ban đầu, bệnh còn có thể gây sưng đau tinh hoàn. Thậm chí, bệnh lậu ở trực tràng còn có thể bị nhầm lẫn với bệnh trĩ, khiến việc chẩn đoán và điều trị bị trì hoãn. 2. Biến chứng nghiêm trọng và hậu quả khôn lường của bệnh lậu Bệnh lậu có thể xảy ra ở cả nam và nữ giới. Ảnh minh họa AI Nếu không được phát hiện và điều trị kịp thời, bệnh lậu có thể gây ra những biến chứng nặng nề, ảnh hưởng trực tiếp đến sức khỏe sinh sản và nhiều cơ quan khác.

Bệnh lậu là bệnh lây nhiễm rất phổ biến thông qua con đường tình dục, do một loại vi khuẩn có tên Neisseria gonorrhoeae hay gonococcus gây nên. Loại vi khuẩn này thường xuất hiện trong âm đạo, cổ tử cung, mắt, miệng, hậu môn và đặc biệt là ở đường niệu đạo nam giới. Bệnh lậu xảy ra ở mọi đối tượng và mọi lứa tuổi nhưng hay gặp nhất là nam nữ trong độ tuổi 15 đến 24. Nguyên nhân bệnh Lậu Nguyên nhân chính gây ra bệnh lậu là song cầu lậu Neisseria. Loại vi khuẩn này tồn tại ở vùng niêm mạc da ẩm thấp, nhạy cảm, dễ bị tổn thương như dương vật, hậu môn, miệng... Ngoài ra, vì loại vi khuẩn này có thể sống được vài phút ở môi trường bên ngoài nên nguyên nhân gián tiếp có thể gây nên bệnh lậu là các dụng cụ dùng chung như khăn mặt, bàn chải đánh răng, vết thương hở, truyền từ mẹ sang con... Triệu chứng bệnh Lậu Bệnh lậu có thể xảy ra ở cả nam lẫn nữ với những triệu chứng khác nhau và không rõ ràng, rất dễ nhầm lẫn với những bệnh viêm nhiễm khác. Tuy nhiên, vẫn có thể chú ý để nhận biết được những triệu chứng của bệnh lậu giai đoạn đầu như sau: Đối với nam giới mắc bệnh lậu : Cảm giác nóng rát khi tiểu tiện. Xuất hiện dịch vàng, trắng, xanh lá tiết ra ở dương vật Cảm giác đau, sưng tinh hoàn Đối với nữ giới mắc bệnh lậu Hầu hết nữ giới khi mắc bệnh lậu đều không có bất kỳ triệu chứng nào. Nếu có triệu chứng cũng là những triệu chứng nhẹ rất dễ nhầm với những bệnh nhiễm trùng khác như nhiễm trùng âm đạo, bàng quang. Chính vì vậy, chúng ta có thể phát hiện một số triệu chứng của bệnh lậu ở nữ giới khi đã chuyển qua giai đoạn nặng như: Đau hoặc nóng rát khi đi tiểu. Tăng tiết dịch vùng âm đạo Chảy máu âm đạo giữa những chu kỳ kinh nguyệt. Ngoài những triệu chứng riêng biệt ở nam và nữ như trên, còn có những triệu chứng xuất hiện ở cả nam và nữ nh"}

Trichomoniasis là gì? Trichomoniasis là một bệnh lây qua đường tình dục (STD) rất thường gặp, xảy ra do bị nhiễm trùng roi Trichomonas vaginalis. Trùng roi này có kích thước từ 10-20 mm và rộng 7 mm, với 5 đôi roi và khả năng di động. Trùng roi Trichomonas vaginalis bị tiêu diệt dễ dàng bởi nhiệt độ và môi trường khô và chỉ có thể tồn tại trong cơ thể người. 2. Triệu chứng nhiễm trùng roi Trichomonas Đến khoảng 70% người nhiễm trùng roi Trichomonas không có triệu chứng hay dấu hiệu cụ thể. Các triệu chứng viêm âm đạo do trùng roi Trichomonas có thể từ kích ứng nhẹ ở âm đạo đến viêm nặng và thường xuất hiện trong khoảng thời gian từ 5 đến 28 ngày sau khi nhiễm. Nếu không có triệu chứng cụ thể, bệnh nhân có thể phải mất rất nhiều thời gian mới thấy dấu hiệu. Bệnh trùng roi đường sinh dục ở nam giới phần lớn không có triệu chứng rõ ràng. Tuy nhiên, một số người có thể gặp phải các triệu chứng như ngứa hoặc kích ứng dương vật, khó khăn khi đi tiểu và đi tiểu nhiều lần, cùng với cảm giác ngứa rát khi tiểu tiện hoặc khi xuất tinh. Trong một số trường hợp, dương vật có thể tiết dịch niệu đạo, làm cho việc phân biệt với viêm niệu đạo - một tình trạng cũng khá phổ biến khác - trở nên khó khăn.

Vẫn có nhiều người đặt ra câu hỏi như: Muỗi đốt có thể làm lây truyền HIV hay không? Ăn chung với người bị nhiễm HIV có bị lây nhiễm HIV không?. Câu trả lời là KHÔNG. Hãy cùng tìm hiểu những đường không lây của HIV: HIV không tồn tại lâu bên ngoài cơ thể người (chẳng hạn như trên bề mặt), và nó không thể sinh sản bên ngoài vật chủ là người. HIV sẽ không lây truyền cho người khác được nếu: (3) ü Truyền đi bởi muỗi, bọ ve, hoặc côn trùng khác. ü Qua nước bọt, nước mắt hoặc mồ hôi. ü Bằng cách ôm, hôn, bắt tay, dùng chung nhà vệ sinh, dùng chung bát đĩa, hoặc với người nhiễm HIV. ü Truyền qua không khí Ngoài ra, hiện nay nhờ tiến bộ của khoa học, nhiễm HIV không còn là án tử hình nữa. Hơn nữa người nhiễm HIV vẫn có cuộc sống tình dục an toàn mà không lo lây truyền HIV cho người khác. Một người nhiễm HIV uống thuốc kháng vi rút (ARV) hàng ngày theo chỉ định, đạt được và duy trì tải lượng vi rút dưới ngưỡng phát hiện (Tải lượng vi rút dưới ngưỡng phát hiện được định nghĩa là dưới 200 bản sao/1mL máu) sẽ thực sự không có nguy cơ làm lây truyền HIV sang cho bạn tình của họ qua đường tình dục. Như vậy, với phát hiện này, người có HIV đang điều trị ARV có tải lượng HIV dưới ngưỡng phát hiện sẽ thể sống cuộc sống với tình dục an toàn. (4) Phòng chống HIV/AIDS Mặc dù không trực tiếp giảm nguy cơ lây nhiễm HIV, việc tham gia xét nghiệm cũng mang lại những tác động tích cực, và do vậy, cũng được xem là một mắt xích quan trọng trong chương trình phòng chống HIV/AIDS. Lợi ích trực tiếp của xét nghiệm HIV là xác định tình trạng huyết thanh của bản thân.

Bệnh Sùi mào gà là gì? Sùi mào gà (Genital warts) là một trong những bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục hay gặp ở nước ta cũng như nhiều nước trên thế giới. Bệnh do virus HPV (Human Papillomavirus - hay còn gọi là virus gây u nhú ở người) gây nên. Bệnh lây chủ yếu do quan hệ tình dục không an toàn. Tuy nhiên, virus này cũng có thể lây qua một số đường tiếp xúc gián tiếp không qua quan hệ tình dục. 2. Nguyên nhân gây bệnh Căn nguyên của bệnh sùi mào gà là virus HPV. Đây là loại virus có ADN và chỉ khu trú ở da và niêm mạc. Cho tới nay người ta đã xác định được khoảng 200 type virus HPV khác nhau, trong đó có khoảng 40 type gây bệnh ở bộ phận sinh dục. Các type virus khác nhau sẽ gây bệnh ở các vùng da, niêm mạc khác nhau, cụ thể: - HPV type 1,4,5,8,41,60,63…gây bệnh hạt cơm ở da, gan bàn tay, bàn chân. - HPV type 6,11,13,16,18,55,66…gây bệnh ở niêm mạc. Đặc biệt type 6, 11 gây bệnh ở bộ phận sinh dục, đây là những type ít có nguy cơ gây ung thư. Tuy nhiên, type 16,18, 31, 33 có nguy cơ cao gây ung thư. - HPV type 5,8 gây bệnh loạn sản thượng bì dạng hạt cơm. 3. Chẩn đoán bệnh sùi mào gà - Dựa vào lâm sàng: các tổn thương dạng u nhú, màu hồng hoặc nâu nhạt, nổi trên bề mặt da, có tăng sinh mạch máu ở trung tâm, đôi khi tập trung thành đám lớn. - Các xét nghiệm: Sinh thiết thương tổn để xem hình ảnh mô bệnh học, xác định ADN của HPV, định type để xác định các type HPV có nguy cơ thấp hay nguy cơ cao gây ung thư. 4. Điều trị sùi mào gà như thế nào Có nhiều cách để điều trị bệnh sùi mào gà, có thể chia thành 2 nhóm chính: một số liên quan đến việc sử dụng thuốc và một số liên quan đến thủ thuật. Ngay cả khi điều trị, sùi mào gà có thể quay trở lại (tái phát) trong vòng vài tuần hoặc vài tháng. Điều này là do "}

Đây là một trong những bệnh nhiễm trùng thường gặp và là vấn đề y tế cộng đồng đáng lưu tâm do tỷ lệ lưu hành và tỷ lệ tái phát cao. Bệnh có thể gây những biến chứng nghiêm trọng như viêm màng não vô khuẩn, nhiễm trùng chu sinh. 1. Nguyên nhân Nguyên nhân gây bệnh herpes sinh dục là HSV. HSV có 2 type: HSV1 (HHV1) và HSV2 (HHV2). HSV1 chủ yếu gây bệnh vùng mặt và HSV2 chủ yếu gây bệnh ở vùng sinh dục. Nhiễm HSV2 thường có biểu hiện lâm sàng nặng hơn và có thể gây biến chứng nghiêm trọng ở não, mắt, phổi. HSV2 cũng làm tăng khả năng nhiễm HIV gấp 3 lần. Nhiễm HSV là tình trạng nhiễm trùng mạn tính, kéo dài suốt đời và hay tái phát. Virus lây truyền qua tiếp xúc trực tiếp da, niêm mạc với dịch chứa virus. Các sang chấn nhỏ trên da, niêm mạc tạo điều kiện cho virus xâm nhập vào các tế bảo biểu mô. Sau nhiễm tiên phát, virus tồn lưu trong hạch thần kinh cảm giác ở trạng thái tiềm ẩn và khi tái hoạt sẽ gây ra những đợt bệnh tái phát. Phụ nữ có thai nhiễm HSV tiên phát khi sinh con có nguy cơ lây nhiễm tới 50% cho con gây nhiễm trùng sơ sinh nặng, có thể dẫn đến tử vong. Nếu mẹ bị nhiễm vào 3 tháng cuối của thai kỳ, có thể gây thai chết lưu hoặc sinh non. 2. Biểu hiện lâm sàng Herpes tiên phát Thương tổn da thường xuất hiện 5-14 ngày sau tiếp xúc tình dục, mụn nước hoặc ban đỏ mọc thành chùm, thường ở cạnh bộ phận sinh dục ngoài, quanh hậu môn hoặc mông. Mụn nước hóa mụn mủ, loét, đóng vảy và thường tự lành sau 2-3 tuần. Tổn thương trên niêm mạc có thể không thấy giai đoạn mụn nước mà đôi khi chỉ thấy loét. Đau, ngứa, rát tại thương tổn.

Ví dụ một bệnh nhân ban đầu nhiễm HSV-1 ở miệng, cơ thể phản ứng bằng cách sinh kháng thể, kháng thể xuất hiện ở lần nhiễm HSV-2 lần sau. Tái phát: Tái hoạt HSV ở thương tổn đường sinh dục cùng loại với kháng thể HSV phát hiện trước đó trong huyết thanh bệnh nhân; 3. PHƯƠNG THỨC LÂY TRUYỀN Lây truyền HSV xảy ra nhanh chóng ở những người có bạn tình mới. Trong một nghiên cứu thuần tập trên 199 bệnh nhân thì thấy thời gian lây truyền HSV trung bình khoảng 3,5 tháng (1,5 - 10,0) sau khi có bạn tình mới, trung bình là sau 40 lần giao hợp. Sử dụng bao cao su không thường xuyên (50% trong lần quan hệ tình dục đầu tiên; 20% trong lần cuối cùng trước khi được chẩn đoán). Thời gian lây nhiễm trung bình của những người có bạn tình đã được khẳng định tình trạng nhiễm HSV dài hơn với những người mà bạn tình chưa biết tình trạng nhiễm (270 ngày so với 60 ngày). Lây truyền HSV có thể xảy ra ngay cả khi không có biểu hiện lâm sàng. 4. BIỂU HIỆN LÂM SÀNG - Mới nhiễm: Biểu hiện lâm sàng giai đoạn này rất khác nhau, từ nhẹ đến nặng như loét sinh dục, tiểu khó, sốt, hạch tại chỗ, đau đầu.

HPV (Human papilloma virus) là một loại virus gây u nhú ở người. Đây là bệnh lây qua đường tình dục phổ biến trên thế giới. Có đến 11-12% dân số thế giới (tương đương 700-800 triệu người) hiện đang nhiễm HPV ở cả nam và nữ. Ở Việt Nam, tỉ lệ nhiễm HPV vào khoảng 8 -11% tùy vùng miền. Có ít nhất 50% phụ nữ đã nhiễm HPV 1 lần trong đời. Một số loại có thể gây ra những vấn đề về sức khỏe như mụn sinh dục và ung thư. Nhưng có những loại vắc-xin có thể ngăn chặn các vấn đề về sức khỏe này. HPV lây lan như thế nào? HPV rất dễ lây. Bạn có thể bị nhiễm HPV thông qua các đường lây truyền sau: (Xếp theo nguy cơ từ cao xuống thấp) 1. Quan hệ tình dục không an toàn với người bệnh (dương vật, âm đạo, hậu môn) 2. Tiếp xúc tay miệng với cơ quan sinh dục đã nhiễm HPV 3. Sử dụng chung đồ cá nhân với người bị nhiễm HPV 4. Lây truyền từ mẹ sang con HPV có thể lây lan ngay cả khi người bệnh không có dấu hiệu hay triệu chứng gì. Bất cứ ai có quan hệ tình dục đều có thể bị HPV, ngay cả khi chỉ có một bạn tình. Bạn cũng có thể xuất hiện triệu chứng của bệnh nhiều năm sau khi quan hệ tình dục với người bị nhiễm. Do đó rất khó để biết bạn bị nhiễm bệnh lần đầu vào lúc nào. C ó bao nhiêu chủng HPV? Có hơn 170 chủng HPV khác nhau, trong đó có khoảng 40 chủng gây bệnh ở bộ phận sinh dục. Các chủng HPV khác nhau sẽ gây bệnh ở các vùng da, niêm mạc khác nhau. Đa phần các type HPV là lành tính, chủ yếu gây mụn cóc ở ngoài da. Một số chủng virus có thể gây ra những vấn đề về sức khỏe như sùi MÀO gà (chủng 6,11…) và nguy cơ gây ung thư (type 16,18,…) HPV có thể gây ra ung thư không? HPV có thể gây bệnh ung thư cổ tử cung và những loại ung thư khác bao gồm ung"}

Em là nữ, em có bạn trai đã quen nhau 2 năm nay, có quan hệ tình dục không sử dụng biện pháp, nay bạn ấy mới nói cho em biết là bạn ấy bị bệnh viêm gan B , vậy bác sĩ cho em hỏi, khả năng lây nhiễm của em có cao không ạ? Xin cảm ơn bác sĩ! Nguyễn Thị Quỳnh (1999) Trả lời Chào bạn! Virus viêm gan B có thể lây truyền qua đường máu, từ mẹ sang con và đường tình dục. Khả năng lây nhiễm của virus viêm gan B qua đường tình dục là khá cao, đặc biệt khi quan hệ tình dục gây chảy máu, tổn thương niêm mạc hoặc bạn tình có số lượng virus cao, tình trạng virus đang hoạt động thì nguy cơ lây nhiễm càng cao. Về phần mình nếu bạn chưa tiêm phòng viêm gan B đủ liều hoặc nồng độ kháng thể kháng viêm gan B trong cơ thể của bạn thấp thì khả năng bảo vệ cơ thể khỏi lây nhiễm càng thấp, tăng nguy cơ mắc bệnh.Vậy bạn nên nhanh chóng đi xét nghiệm tình trạng nhiễm viêm gan B của mình, tiêm phòng ngay cho bản thân nếu chưa nhiễm và có kế hoạch sử dụng bao cao su khi quan hệ tình dục trước khi có đầy đủ kháng thể bảo vệ bạn nhé. Tuy nhiên bạn đừng chủ quan khi đã tiêm phòng vắc-xin viêm gan B thì có thể ngăn ngừa 100% nguy cơ lây nhiễm và có thể quan hệ tình dục không lây nhiễm với người bị viêm gan B bạn nhé. Mặc dù vắc-xin có hiệu quả bảo vệ rất cao, nhưng không đạt tới 100%. Bạn nên kiểm tra nồng độ kháng thể Ab trong máu không dưới 10 mlU/ml. Quan hệ tình dục an toàn với người viêm gan B và điều trị cả cho bạn tình tránh tình trạng virus hoạt động bạn nhé. Cảm ơn bạn đã đặt câu hỏi tới Hệ thống Y tế Vinmec . Trân trọng.

Viêm gan B là gì? Viêm gan B là một bệnh truyền nhiễm nguy hiểm, gây tổn thương gan cấp tính và mạn tính, gây ra bởi virus viêm gan B . Bệnh viêm gan B là một vấn đề sức khỏe toàn cầu hiện nay, được quan tâm không kém bệnh Ung thư và các bệnh lý không lây nhiễm. Trên thế giới, 2 tỷ người đã từng bị nhiễm virus viêm gan B tại một thời điểm nào đó trong cuộc đời họ. Hiện nay có khoảng gần 400 triệu người mắc viêm gan B trên toàn cầu và khoảng gần 1 triệu người tử vong mỗi năm, chủ yếu do các biến chứng như xơ gan, ung thư gan. Việt Nam nằm trong khu vực có tỷ lệ nhiễm virus viêm gan B khá cao. Hiện có gần 9 triệu người nhiễm virus viêm gan B (khoảng 9% ở nữ và 12% ở nam). Đây là nguyên nhân chính gây ung thư gan và xơ gan tại nước ta. 2. Virus viêm gan B lây như thế nào? Virus viêm gan B có nhiều ở trong máu và các dịch cơ thể như tinh dịch và dịch âm đạo. Virus viêm gan B cũng có trong các dịch khác như: Nước bọt, nước mắt, sữa, nước tiểu tuy nhiên với lượng rất nhỏ nên không đủ để lây truyền qua các đường này. Do đó có 3 con đường lây nhiễm viêm gan B : Qua đường máu, đường quan hệ tình dục và lây truyền từ mẹ sang con. 2.1. Lây qua đường máu Một người có thể bị lây nhiễm viêm gan B qua đường máu khi: Máu người bị nhiễm viêm gan B được đưa vào máu người chưa bị nhiễm và không được bảo vệ. Các hoàn cảnh hay bị lây nhiễm viêm gan B qua đường máu như: Truyền máu của người bị viêm gan B cho người khác Dùng chung xilanh, tiếp xúc trực tiếp với máu của người bị nhiễm"}

Lây từ mẹ sang con Mẹ bị nhiễm viêm gan B nguy cơ cao lây cho con trong quá trình mang thai. Đây là con đường lây truyền chính viêm gan B trên thế giới hiện nay. Khoảng 1/2 số trường hợp lây nhiễm thông qua con đường này. Lây truyền từ mẹ sang con chủ yếu xảy ra trong quá trình đẻ, quá trình mang thai tỉ lệ lây nhiễm rất thấp, chỉ khoảng 2%. Nguy cơ lây nhiễm từ mẹ sang con phụ thuộc vào mức độ nhân lên của virus viêm gan B trong cơ thể mẹ và tải lượng virus viêm gan B trong máu mẹ. Tỷ lệ lây nhiễm viêm gan B từ mẹ sang con sẽ cao hơn nếu mẹ bị nhiễm viêm gan B có sự hiện diện của HBeAg. Sự hiện diện của kháng nguyên HBeAg chứng tỏ lượng virus trong máu đang nhân lên và người bệnh có khả năng lây nhiễm cao. Nếu HBeAg dương tính, tỉ lệ mẹ lây sang con là khoảng 90%. 2.3. Lây qua đường quan hệ tình dục Viêm gan B có thể lây qua con đường quan hệ tình dục do tiếp xúc với tinh dịch, dịch âm đạo, máu (nếu có tổn thương da), viêm gan B lây qua đường tình dục dễ hơn so với virus HIV từ 50 - 100 lần. Các hình thức quan hệ tình dục gây tổn thương niêm mạc, chảy máu thì nguy cơ lây nhiễm virus viêm gan B càng cao như: Quan hệ tình dục đường miệng, đường hậu môn, quan hệ đồng giới nam, quan hệ với nhiều bạn tình hay quan hệ với trai, gái mại dâm. 3. Tiêm vacxin viêm gan B có phòng được bệnh không? Rất may là viêm gan B có thể phòng được bằng tiêm vacxin đầy đủ. Vacxin viêm gan B được bắt đầu sử dụng từ năm 1982, hiện nay được sử dụng tại hầu hết các quốc gia trên thế giới. Tại Việt Nam, vacxin viêm gan B đã được đưa vào Chương trình Tiêm chủng mở rộng quốc gia áp dụng cho tất cả trẻ em được sinh ra. Trẻ được tiêm 4 mũi vacxin viêm gan B vào 24h đầu sau sinh, tháng thứ 2, 3, 4 trong vắc xin phối hợp 5 trong 1 chứa thành phần viêm gan B. Ngoài ra, trong tiêm chủng dịch vụ, viêm"}

Tuy nhiên, vắc xin này không thể ngăn ngừa các bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục khác và tránh thai. Bệnh nguy hiểm nhất mà vaccine HPV có thể phòng ngừa được là bệnh ung thư cổ tử cung và là “cơn ác mộng” của chị em phụ nữ. Đây là bệnh lý ác tính của biểu mô lát (biểu mô vảy) hoặc biểu mô tuyến cổ tử cung. Ung thư cổ tử cung là ung thư sinh dục phổ biến nhất ở phụ nữ tại các nước kém phát triển.

Hai loại vắc xin này được sản xuất bởi hãng dược phẩm hàng đầu thế giới Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) - Mỹ. Thống kê năm 2023 của Tổ chức Y tế Thế giới (WHO), HPV liên quan hơn 690.000 ca mắc ung thư mới ở cả hai giới mỗi năm, bao gồm ung thư tại cổ tử cung, hầu họng, hậu môn,... Do đó, việc tiêm chủng HPV cho trẻ từ 9 tuổi đến người lớn 45 tuổi rất quan trọng và cần thiết. Vắc xin HPV là một trong số ít các loại vắc xin có thể phòng hiệu quả bệnh ung thư. Tiêm vắc xin phòng HPV có thể giúp bảo vệ người được tiêm, bạn tình của họ và gia tăng khả năng miễn dịch trong cộng đồng, giảm tỷ lệ virus lưu hành. Mũi tiêm cũng giúp tiết kiệm chi phí điều trị bệnh nếu có. Theo một nghiên cứu công bố năm 2017 trên tạp chí BMC, vắc xin có thể giúp giảm đến 8.000 USD (khoảng 200 triệu đồng) chi phí chăm sóc hậu bệnh do virus này gây ra. 1.

Nếu chỉ tiêm 1 mũi vắc xin HPV, tính sinh miễn dịch của vắc xin sẽ không đảm bảo, người tiêm có nguy cơ nhiễm HPV vì kháng thể từ 1 mũi vắc xin không đủ bảo vệ. Vắc xin Gardasil có phác đồ ba mũi, không thay đổi theo độ tuổi. Còn vắc xin Gardasil 9, số mũi tiêm có sự thay đổi, khác biệt giữa nhóm chưa đủ 15 tuổi và nhóm còn lại. Trẻ em dưới 15 tuổi tiêm chủng hai mũi vắc xin đã sinh kháng thể toàn diện với bệnh. Nhóm từ 15-45 tuổi cần tiêm phác đồ 3 mũi.

Tổ chức Y tế Thế giới (WHO) khuyến nghị, tiêm 2 liều vắc xin ngừa HPV (loại Gardasil 9) cho trẻ từ 9 đến dưới 15 tuổi cung cấp đáp ứng miễn dịch và kháng thể tốt nhất. Vì vậy, đối tượng từ 9 - 14 tuổi được chỉ định tiêm 2 mũi HPV ngừa 9 chủng đã có khả năng phòng ngừa các bệnh nguy hiểm do HPV gây ra. Tuy nhiên, đối với người tiêm loại vắc xin Gardasil hay nhóm tuổi từ 15 - 45 tuổi tiêm vắc xin Gardasil 9, Bộ Y tế Việt Nam chỉ định cần tiêm đầy đủ 3 mũi để mang lại hiệu quả cao nhất.

Bạn không cần xét nghiệm trước khi tiêm vắc xin phòng HPV. Nam và nữ giới trong độ tuổi từ 9 - 45, không mang thai, không dị ứng với thành phần nào của vắc xin, không trong quá trình điều trị các bệnh cấp tính… đều đủ điều kiện tiêm vắc xin HPV mà không cần xét nghiệm. Thực tế, việc xét nghiệm HPV trước khi tiêm vắc xin là không cần thiết. Bởi vì vắc xin HPV hoạt động như một lá chắn bảo vệ cơ thể trước khi HPV có cơ hội gây hại. Việc cơ thể đã từng tiếp xúc với HPV hay chưa không ảnh hưởng đến hiệu quả của vắc xin. Khi tiêm vắc xin, cơ thể sẽ sản xuất ra các kháng thể đặc hiệu, chủ động chống lại virus, giúp người được tiêm tránh được nguy cơ mắc bệnh. Bên cạnh đó, kết quả xét nghiệm cũng không thể phản ánh được hiệu quả của vắc xin. Kết quả xét nghiệm HPV dương tính không phải lúc nào cũng cho biết bản thân mắc chủng HPV nào. Ngược lại, kết quả âm tính không thể cho biết liệu trước đây bản thân có từng bị nhiễm virus hay không. Và cho dù có nhiễm HPV hay không, việc tiêm vắc xin HPV vẫn rất cần thiết và vắc xin vẫn có thể tạo ra kháng thể để bảo vệ người được tiêm khỏi nguy cơ nhiễm mới, tái nhiễm cùng các gánh nặng bệnh tật nghiêm trọng do HPV gây ra. Vì vậy, việc tiêm vắc xin vẫn mang lại lợi ích phòng ngừa, bất kể kết quả xét nghiệm như thế nào. Do đó, không cần phải xét nghiệm HPV hay tầm soát ung thư trước khi tiêm. Trường hợp nào cần xét nghiệm trước khi tiêm HPV? Dù xét nghiệm trước khi tiêm vắc xin HPV không phải là yêu cầu bắt buộc đối với hầu hết mọi người, nhưng có một số trường hợp đặc biệt có thể được khuyến nghị xét nghiệm, bao gồm: Có triệu chứng nghi ngờ nhiễm HPV: Nếu đang gặp phải các triệu chứng như mụn cóc sinh dục, sùi mào gà hoặc dấu hiệu khác nghi ngờ nhiễm HPV, bác sĩ có thể khuyến cáo người bệnh xét nghiệm HPV"}

Chlamydia là một loại vi sinh vật trung gian giữa vi khuẩn và virus do hệ thống gen di truyền của Chlamydia có thể xếp vào nhóm virus, cũng có thể xếp vào nhóm vi khuẩn. Bệnh Chlamydia đứng đầu trong các bệnh nhiễm khuẩn lây qua đường tình dục. Nguyên nhân chính của bệnh Chlamydia là quan hệ tình dục không an toàn và nạo hút thai . Điều trị theo chỉ dẫn của bác sĩ, điều trị bằng thuốc kháng sinh. Lưu ý cần phải điều trị cả bạn tình. Bệnh Chlamydia vẫn bị bỏ sót nhiều do các nguyên nhân như: + Các triệu chứng mờ nhạt, ít gây khó chịu cho bệnh nhân do vậy mọi người đều bỏ qua không đi khám, không điều trị kịp thời. + Các xét nghiệm để chẩn đoán bệnh phức tạp và đắt tiền, không phải cơ sở y tế nào cũng thực hiện được. + Bệnh phối hợp với các bệnh khác như lậu, tạp khuẩn vì vậy khi điều trị chỉ tập trung điều trị các nguyên nhân trên nên vi khuẩn Chlamydia vẫn tồn tại và tiếp tục gây bệnh. 2. Biểu hiện của bệnh Chlamydia Nam giới: Biểu hiện bệnh ở nam thường nghèo nàn nên người bệnh chủ quan và dễ bị nhầm lẫn với bệnh lậu mãn tính. Thời gian "}

Vì vậy, người bệnh cần đi gặp bác sĩ để được chẩn đoán và điều trị kịp thời nhằm hạn chế nguy cơ tái đi tái lại. Cùng tìm hiểu thông tin chi tiết về bệnh lý viêm âm đạo do trùng roi trong bài viết này nhé. Bài viết được tham vấn chuyên môn cùng Bác sĩ chuyên khoa II Trần Thị Mai Hương - Bác sĩ Sản phụ khoa - Khoa Sản phụ khoa - Bệnh viện Đa khoa Quốc tế Vinmec Hải Phòng. 1. Viêm âm đạo do trichomonas là gì? Một trong ba loại viêm âm đạo phổ biến nhất là Trichomonas . Hai loại còn lại bao gồm viêm âm đạo do vi khuẩn (BV) và viêm âm đạo do nấm candida. Viêm âm đạo do Trichomonas là một loại bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục (STI) rất phổ biến. Tên bệnh này bắt nguồn từ tác nhân gây bệnh là trùng roi Trichomonas vaginalis. Bệnh không chỉ gây viêm âm đạo ở phụ nữ mà còn dẫn đến viêm niệu đạo ở nam giới. Đối với phụ nữ, viêm âm đạo do Trichomonas sẽ xuất hiện với các triệu chứng như dịch âm đạo có màu sắc và mùi bất thường, ngứa và đau âm đạo. Ngoài ra, phụ nữ mang thai bị viêm âm đạo do trùng roi có nguy cơ gặp phải tình trạng sinh non cao hơn so với những người không mắc bệnh. 2. Kháng sinh điều trị viêm âm đạo do trùng roi Trichomonas là một loại vi sinh dễ phản ứng khi được điều trị đúng tác nhân. Việc điều trị kháng sinh càng sớm càng giúp phụ nữ giảm nhanh các triệu chứng khó chịu và hạn chế khả năng lây truyền cho bạn tình. Bên cạnh đó, những dấu hiệu suy giảm miễn dịch ở phụ nữ mắc HIV cũng sẽ bị kìm hãm một phần khi điều trị viêm âm đạo do Trichomonas.

SKĐS - Giang mai là bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục, ngoài các trường hợp có biểu hiện rõ ràng còn có những trường hợp giang mai “kín”, bệnh nhân hoàn toàn không có biểu hiện lâm sàng gì. Vậy làm sao để phát hiện bệnh? Tỉ lệ mắc giang mai trên thế giới nói chung và ở Việt Nam nói riêng ngày càng tăng. Tình trạng này có liên quan đến sự gia tăng quần thể quan hệ tình dục đồng giới và xu hướng quan hệ sớm, không an toàn ở thanh thiếu niên. Bệnh giang mai có biểu hiện đa dạng, phức tạp, không chỉ ở da, niêm mạc mà còn có thể ở các cơ quan khác như tai, mắt, cơ xương khớp, tim mạch, thần kinh. Các triệu chứng có thể tiến triển, thay đổi trên cùng một bệnh nhân, dễ nhầm lẫn với các bệnh lý khác. Vì vậy, giang mai còn được mệnh danh là “kẻ trá hình hoàn hảo”. Ngoài ra, có những trường hợp giang mai “kín”, bệnh nhân hoàn toàn không có biểu hiện lâm sàng gì cho đến khi được làm xét nghiệm kiểm tra. Vì vậy, những người có tiền sử tiếp xúc, quan hệ tình dục không an toàn hoặc có những biểu hiện nghi ngờ bệnh lây truyền qua đường tình dục nên đi khám bác sĩ chuyên khoa Da liễu để được chẩn đoán và điều trị kịp thời. Các bệnh nhân khi có tổn thương da vùng sinh dục không nên tự dùng thuốc bôi, thuốc uống tự điều trị. Có nhiều nguyên nhân có thể dẫn đến loét vùng sinh dục, bệnh nhân cần được thăm khám kỹ để chẩn đoán chính xác nguyên nhân. Việc tự dùng thuốc bôi, thuốc uống khi chưa biết nguyên nhân có thể làm thay đổi triệu chứng ban đầu, làm sai lệch kết quả xét nghiệm dẫn đến trì hoãn trong việc chẩn đoán và điều trị đúng. Cần lưu ý, bạn tình hiện tại và trong vòng 1 năm của người mắc giang mai cần được đi khám, làm xét nghiệm giang mai và điều trị bệnh nếu có. Nếu bạn tình của bệnh nhân không được chẩn đoán và điều trị, bện"}

Bệnh lây truyền chủ yếu qua đường máu, quan hệ tình dục và đặc biệt là từ mẹ sang con. Đây cũng là nguyên nhân chính gây ra khoảng 80% số ca ung thư gan trên toàn thế giới. Tại Việt Nam, các nghiên cứu cho thấy khoảng 10-20% phụ nữ mang thai nhiễm HBV. Đáng lo ngại hơn, trong số những người mẹ có HBeAg dương tính, có tới 90% trẻ sinh ra có nguy cơ nhiễm virus nếu không được can thiệp kịp thời. Lây nhiễm xảy ra chủ yếu trong quá trình chuyển dạ và lúc sinh, do đó việc phát hiện sớm và điều trị dự phòng có vai trò rất quan trọng. Phụ nữ mang thai cần được xét nghiệm viêm gan siêu vi B ngay trong lần khám thai đầu tiên. Nếu phát hiện nhiễm virus, cần được đánh giá tải lượng HBV DNA hoặc xét nghiệm HBeAg để xác định nguy cơ lây truyền. Với trường hợp tải lượng virus ≥ 200.000 IU/mL hoặc HBeAg dương tính, bác sĩ sẽ chỉ định điều trị dự phòng từ tháng thứ 6 hoặc 7 của thai kỳ bằng thuốc kháng virus an toàn. Ngay cả khi không thể làm các xét nghiệm chuyên sâu, chỉ cần HBsAg dương tính thì cũng nên được điều trị dự phòng. Sau sinh, mẹ cần được theo dõi lại chức năng gan và tải lượng virus sau 3 tháng, rồi tiếp tục đánh giá định kỳ. Về phía trẻ sơ sinh, tất cả trẻ cần được tiêm vaccine viêm gan siêu vi B trong vòng 24 giờ đầu sau sinh. Với những trẻ có mẹ nhiễm HBV, cần tiêm thêm huyết thanh kháng virus ngay sau sinh, đồng thời tiếp tục tiêm đủ các mũi vaccine theo chương trình tiêm chủng mở rộng. Khi trẻ được 7 đến 12 tháng tuổi, cần làm xét nghiệm HBsAg để kiểm tra hiệu quả phòng ngừa. Nếu dương tính, trẻ cần được theo dõi tại cơ sở y tế chuyên khoa để được quản lý và điều trị kịp thời. Một điều quan trọng là những bà mẹ đang điều trị hoặc dự phòng viêm gan siêu vi B "}

VGB là bệnh nhiễm vi rut nặng ảnh hưởng đến gan. VIÊM GAN B MẠN TÍNH LÀ GÌ Một số người trưởng thành và nhiều trẻ em dưới 5 tuổi bị nhiễm VGB và vi rút VGB tồn tại kéo dài trên 6 tháng. Hầu hết những người này không có biểu hiện bệnh. Một số diễn tiến sang xơ gan, ung thư gan và chết sớm. NHIỄM VIÊM GAN B CẤP LÀ GÌ? Nhiễm cấp là trong vòng 6 tháng sau khi bị nhiễm bệnh thì người bệnh có các triệu chứng sau: Mệt mỏi, ăn không ngon, nôn và ói, vàng da (vàng da và mắt), đau dạ dày, đau cơ và khớp. Nhiễm trùng tự khỏi hoàn toàn trong vòng vài tuần mà không cần điều trị. Những người này tiêu diệt được vi rút VGB và có miễn dịch với bệnh và không bị nhiễm nữa. VIÊM GAN B LÂY TRUYỀN THẾ NÀO? VGB lây qua tiếp xúc trực tiếp với dịch cơ thể như máu, dịch âm đạo, tinh dịch của người bị nhiễm bệnh. Việc lây bệnh có thể xảy ra khi quan hệ tình dục không được bảo vệ hay quan hệ tình dục đồng giới nam; qua việc hiến máu không được sàng lọc; dùng chung bơm kim tiêm. Nhất là khi mẹ bị nhiễm bệnh VGB thì trẻ có thể bị nhiễm bệnh khi sinh. Bệnh có thể lây qua vật dụng cá nhân (bàn chải đánh răng) nếu sử dụng chung. VGB không lây qua sữa mẹ, không lây qua tiếp xúc thông thường như dùng chung dụng cụ ăn uống, ôm, hôn, nắm tay. VIÊM GAN B ẢNH HƯỞNG ĐẾN THAI NHƯ THẾ NÀO? Nhiễm trùng VGB có thể ảnh hưởng nặng đến trẻ, đe dọa cuộc sống của trẻ. Trẻ bị nhiễm có nguy cơ cao đến 90% thành người nhiễm VGB mạn tính. Trẻ cũng có thể lây cho người khác. Khi trẻ trưởng thành, có 25% nguy cơ tử vong vì xơ gan. hoặc ung thư gan. VIÊM GAN B CÓ CHỮA ĐƯỢC KHÔNG? VGB có thuốc điều trị làm giảm số lượng vi rút, giảm tốc độ tiến triển bệnh, giảm biến chứng xơ gan và ung thư gan. Có vắc xin ngăn ngừa VGB. Người mới tiếp xúc với vi rút viêm gan B mà chưa tiêm ngừa vắc xin thì có thể tiêm 1 liều"}

Ung thư có nguồn gốc từ cổ tử cung là một trong những ung thư phụ khoa thường gặp nhất Tuổi sinh sản của mỗi phụ nữ là không giống nhau, phụ thuộc vào hoạt động nội tiết và phóng noãn của buồng trứng. Thông thường, mãn kinh bắt đầu ở độ tuổi từ 45 đến 55 tuổi. Tuy nhiên ở một số phụ nữ, mãn kinh xảy ra sớm hơn. Thông thường, trứng đã thụ tinh sẽ làm tổ ở niêm mạc tử cung. Nhưng với mang thai ngoài tử cung (còn gọi là mang thai ngoài dạ con), trứng đã thụ tinh cấy và phát triển bên ngoài tử cung của bạn, ở những vị trí như ống dẫn trứng, buồng trứng, trong ổ bụng hoặc cổ tử cung. Hơn 90% trường hợp thai ngoài tử cung bám vào ống dẫn trứng. Đây là một biến chứng mang thai nguy hiểm, có thể gây chảy máu ồ ạt, sốc và thậm chí tử vong nếu không được phát hiện và điều trị kịp thời. Loãng xương là bệnh rất thường gặp ở phụ nữ lớn tuổi, sau mãn kinh. Hiện nay loãng xương đang có xu hướng gia tăng do tuổi thọ trung bình tăng và một số thay đổi trong lối sống khiến con người ít vận động.
